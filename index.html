    "description": "Robbie is investigating the feasibility of detecting the presence of Ramalina menziesii, a lichen species, using imaging spectroscopy. His approach involves simulating spectral mixtures at varying levels of fungal coverage, then applying spectral unmixing techniques to estimate the abundance of Ramalina in mixed pixels. Using a Python-based synthetic data pipeline, Robbie generates mixtures from real endmember spectra stored in CSV formatâ€”representing pure spectra of soil, vegetation, and the target fungus. He tests limits of detection (LOD) for fungal presence and may expand the work to real airborne imagery (AVIRIS-3 L2A) over known lichen habitats. His analysis contributes to the advancement of fungal detection in remote sensing."

Using EMIT imagery, he performs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) followed by SMA to estimate sub-pixel vegetation fractions. These refined vegetation inputs are then used to drive the PT-JPL ET model, producing ET, PET, and latent heat estimates. Nimay compares outputs from both NDVI and SMA inputs spatially and statistically, highlighting differences in modeled ET rates. If available, he plans to validate model outputs with ground-based flux tower observations.
